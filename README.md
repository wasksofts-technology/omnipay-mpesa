# omnipay-mpesa
Alias wasksofts/omnipay mpesa

The Lipa na MPesa (LNM) API is an API designed to utilize the new feature introduced by Safaricom known as STK Push. 
This feature allows the transaction initiation to be moved from the paying customer's side to the payee Organization's side. 
This eliminates the challenge of having to remember business paybill numbers and account numbers and allows customers to simply 
confirm the transaction by entering their MPesa PIN on their mobile phone. 
This is done via the STK push/Pop-up which appears on a customer's phone that prompts them to enter their PIN. 
For the business, this API enables them to preset all the correct info in the payment request and 
reduce chances of wrong payments being performed to their systems. 
It is a C2B transaction, but with the initiator being the organization instead of the customer. 
Since the organization has the option of presetting all required variables in the request before sending the request,
this API has no Validation-Confirmation process like the previous C2B API.

## TL;DR
Just want to see some code? 

      use Omnipay\Omnipay;
      use Omnipay\Mpesa;

      $gateway = Omnipay::create('Mpesa');
      $gateway->setShortCode('174379');
      $gateway->setConsumerKey('');
      $gateway->setConsumerSecret('');
      $gateway->setPassKey('');
      $gateway->setTestMode('sandbox'); 

          $purchase = $gateway->purchase(array(
             'amount' => '100',
             'phone_number' => '254708374149',
             'account' => 'apitest',
             'description' => 'This is a purchase',
             'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/callback_url.php',
           ));
           
           
           if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
                 echo "Input your pin to purchase!";

           }else{
               // Payment failed
               return $response->getMessage();
          } 

          $data = $response->getData();
          echo '<pre>';print_r($data);echo '</pre>';

##  Your callback url should have this:
    /**
     * Use this to process the STK push request callback
     */
        $callbackJSONData=file_get_contents('php://input');
        $callbackData=json_decode($callbackJSONData);

        $result=[
            "resultDesc"=>$callbackData->Body->stkCallback->ResultDesc,
            "resultCode"=>$callbackData->Body->stkCallback->ResultCode,
            "merchantRequestID"=>$callbackData->Body->stkCallback->MerchantRequestID,
            "checkoutRequestID"=>$callbackData->Body->stkCallback->CheckoutRequestID,
            "amount"=>$callbackData->Body->stkCallback->CallbackMetadata->Item[0]->Value,
            "mpesaReceiptNumber"=>$callbackData->Body->stkCallback->CallbackMetadata->Item[1]->Value,
            "transactionDate"=>$callbackData->Body->stkCallback->CallbackMetadata->Item[3]->Value,
            "phoneNumber"=>$callbackData->Body->stkCallback->CallbackMetadata->Item[4]->Value
        ];

        return json_encode($result);
    //you can save json_data on database
